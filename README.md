# Funding

REST framework is a *collaboratively funded project*. If you use
REST framework commercially we strongly encourage you to invest in its
continued development by [signing up for a paid plan][funding].

The initial aim is to provide a single full-time position on REST framework.
*Every single sign-up makes a significant impact towards making that possible.*

# Overview

Django REST framework is a powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs.

Some reasons you might want to use REST framework:

* The [Web browsable API][sandbox] is a huge usability win for your developers.
* [Authentication policies][authentication] including optional packages for [OAuth1a][oauth1-section] and [OAuth2][oauth2-section].
* [Serialization][serializers] that supports both [ORM][modelserializer-section] and [non-ORM][serializer-section] data sources.
* Customizable all the way down - just use [regular function-based views][functionview-section] if you don't need the [more][generic-views] [powerful][viewsets] [features][routers].
* [Extensive documentation][docs], and [great community support][group].

There is a live example API for testing purposes, [available here][sandbox].
